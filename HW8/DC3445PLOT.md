CLARITY: Is easy to read the principal topic but is confusing in the quantities because the Number of Total Building Units starts in a negative number. 
ESTHETIC: The colors are chosen appropriately, the difference between the colors make the plot easy to read it. The elements are used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized. The choices allow to focus on the right elements.
HONESTY: The plot honestly reproducing the data
SUGGESTIONS:My suggestion is just a change in the scale, erase the data that is and outlier.
