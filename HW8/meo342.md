CLARITY: This plot is easy to read, it can be observed that there is a tendency in the grown of the population and the increase of carbon emissions.
The quantities are shown but is necessary to add units.

ESTHETIC: The colors used are appropriate, the axes are a little bit confusing maybe is necessary to add if it was made in a logarithmic scale. But in general the graphical choices allow to focus in the right elements.

HONESTY: The plot honestly reproducing the data and emphasize the point of the correlation between both variables.

SUGGESTION: My suggestion is just add units and specify the scale.
