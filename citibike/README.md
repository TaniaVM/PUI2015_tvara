Description of the project:
  The idea was trying to find a positive correlation between the Moon Brightness and the rides in citibike.
My contribution was:
  1.	Download de information from “Citibike” between July and August from 2013 and 2014 and match this information with the data of Sunrise and Sunset to define the hours of nights. http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/usa/new-york?month=8&year=2015
2.	After having this data base, join the information of the moon and define which was the rides that were during moon. http://www.timeanddate.com/moon/phases/usa/new-york?year=2015
3.	Cleaning data base to upload into a csv file in the ipython notebook.
4.	Making analysis of trip duration in the Moon days before running the program to find if these days has a difference over the other days.

Extra library for python: Seaborn
